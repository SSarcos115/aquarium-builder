Hi there! 

Welcome to my aquarium builder project (still working on the title name)...

Anyways, this passion project is something I have thought of for months before I started. 

I took direct inspiration from Pc Part Picker (https://pcpartpicker.com/) on how it should look and behave. 

I really liked how simple the website felt while still having complexity within it. Plus the aesthetic is just so nice and clean. 

Thank you for checking out my first full-length, work-in-progess project. I hope you enjoy!
